## ðŸŽ£ ExtraFish

A Minecraft plugin that adds varieties of fish for each biome.

#### Install

1. Download the latest version of the plugin .jar file [here](https://github.com/joeykilpatrick/ExtraFish/releases).
2. Copy the .jar to your Spigot/Paper server's `plugins` folder.
3. Run the server.

When joining the server, you should be prompted to automatically download the needed resource pack. If you do not, all fish will appear with the same texture.


#### Goal

I would like to make this plugin as simplistic and vanilla-feeling as possible. My hope is that the mod feels like a natural extension of the vanilla experience. Customization and configuration are not priorities. 

I am making heavy use of ChatGPT to generate images for inspiration. The output images are then edited to make them match the vanilla art style.
